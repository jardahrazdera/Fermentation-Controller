Fermentation Controller

A scalable fermentation process control system designed for breweries. This project runs on a Raspberry Pi with UniPi hardware, featuring automated temperature regulation, valve management, and real-time monitoring. Built with Django and SQLite, it provides a modern, user-friendly dashboard for efficient brewing operations.

Key features include:
	•	Automated temperature control for up to 8 fermentation tanks
	•	Valve and pump management with safety features like “Total Stop”
	•	Historical data tracking stored in a local database
	•	Scalable architecture for additional tanks and sensors
